			<h2 class=" mt-5">&#128270; Research & Mapping</h1>
            <p>Having previous experience with music streaming mobile applications at JB Hi-Fi I had fair understanding of the task ahead, although the need to bring this project to mutiple asian markets presented a huge challenge. </p>
            <p>Once a full feature list had been documented and the basic application flow was decided, clickable prototypes for user testing and sales presentations was created. Through these trials, the following features and restrictions evolved:</p>


			<div class="definition-box">
				<h3>Features & Restrictions</h3>
				<small>
					<ol>
						<li><h4>Rebrandable</h4> Each client required custom logo, splash, colour scheme, and unique music curation.</li>
						<li><h4>Translatable</h4> Textual UI elements must be short, simple to translate with universal icon comprehension.</li>
						<li><h4>Simple</h4> UX must have as little onboarding and be as intuitive as possible.</li>
						<li><h4>Fast</h4> Startup and music buffering must be invisible and any delays to be as well-handled as possible.</li>
						<li><h4>Full Featured</h4> All the expected music app features of the time.</li>
						<li><h4>Light Footprint</h4> Install size and music cache must be minimal and user manageable.</li>
						<li><h4>Low Overhead</h4> Must work on the most common low-end mobile devices.</li>
					</ol>

            <h2 class="mt-5">&#128736; Final Product</h1>
            <p>The end result was sold into mutiple countries, and continues to be a valuable product in Tuned Global toolkit.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Custom designed UI icon font</li>
				<li>New internationalised music meta-data CMS</li>
				<li>Stress-tested to 11,000 concurrent users</li>
