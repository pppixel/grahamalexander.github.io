			<h3 class="mb-0">Overview</h3>
			<p class="m-0">Small businesses and agencies have trouble understanding and trusting traditional media advertising, now with digital advertising taking at least 90% of marketing budgets, buyers are used to (mostly) transparent online experiences where they understand everything involved and have access to tools for researching, planning and evaluating ROI.</p>

			<h2 class=" mt-5">&#128270; Research & Mapping</h2>
            <p>I began by analysing the workflow and procedures of complex agency booking systems, meeting and talking to buyers and sales teams. </p>

            <p>While all buyers had specific campaign requirements, the biggest factors regarding purchases were always price and response time. And if a sales person could respond quickly enough with an accurate understanding of the campaign, then price may be less important.

            <h2 class="mt-5">&#128300; Wireframes & Userflows</h2>
            <div class="definition-box">
                <h4 class="m-0">User flow</h4>
                <p class="m-0">A series of steps a user takes to achieve a meaningful goal.</p>
            </div>
            <p>While each step could be transformed into an online workflow, timely communication and up-to-the-second pricing play a major role in each decision point. The challenge was figuring out how to minimise these time-gaps without impeding the sales team's day-to-day flow.</p>
            <p>The InfomoMedia platform required the management of multiple object types, workflow styles, public and administration areas. The goal was to reduce the learning curve for the sales workflow by prioritizing the most relevant tasks.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">&#128736; Final Prototype</h2>
            <p>An Angular front end and GraphQL api was created to provide a fully working prototype, with enough features to take to market including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>multi-lingual & multi-currency </li>
                <li>customisation & brand switching for tailored pitch meetings</li>
                <li>ability to manage and sell any media type, not just outdoor</li>
            </ul>
